*These will involve model fitting/selection

All the teaching materials, including the lectures, jupter notebooks, code, and data are at [this git repository](https://github.com/vectorbite/VBiTraining2).

## The Teaching Tools

We will be using `R`. The materials will be delivered through lectures and [Jupyter notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vectorbite/VBiTraining2/blob/master/notebooks/Index.ipynb). If you would like to use jupyter (not required for the workshop), have a look at this [Intro to Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/notebooks/Intro.ipynb), or something else online.

## How to prepare for the Workshop

 * We are assuming familarity with `R` basics. Here are some resources for brushing up (and there are many more online -- pick something that suits your learning style):
     - [Samraat's notes](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/silbiocomp/SilBioComp.pdf) - The Intro to R Chapter, but more if you want
     - [try R](https://hangouts.google.com/_/elUi/chat-redirect?dest=http%3A%2F%2Ftryr.codeschool.com%2F)
     - https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/
     - https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=10907-287229
     - https://kingaa.github.io/R_Tutorial/

A good bit of the traing will focus on data visualization. In particular, you might want to have a look at [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/). There is a section on this in the [Workshop notes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vectorbite/VBiTraining2/blob/master/notebooks/Index.ipynb),  but plenty of other online resources are available --- just google ggplot!

  * Bring your laptop. Any operating system/platform will do.

  * Have R (version 3.2 or higher) installed.

  * Have some code editor installed. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a great option, as it is a good code editor + a inuitive [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface).

  * Inculcate the coding Jedi inside of you - or the Sith - whatever works.

# For Instructors

## General instructions

* Please add your files to `lectures`, `notebooks`, `code`, or `data` directories, as needed; all workshop sessions will share these directories
* If you want to share old materials taht will be up-cycled to the current workshop, please put them in the `old_materials` directory, under a subdirectory
  * Each of these should ideally include working examples, each with its own code and data etc directories as needed/appropriate.
* If there are Readings (papers, reports, etc) or Resources (cheat-sheets, etc) put them in those named directories at the same level as `code`, `data`, etc.
* We are using R. Minimize from using too many special packages, unless you want to teach how to use them.
* We will be using [jupyter](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/notebooks/Intro.ipynb), but you may include the training material as an R-MarkDown file (`.Rmd`), outputting a pdf, which we will covert to jupyter.
* Start each discrete session/tutorial by stating its goal and pre-requisites (including packages needed), all under a clear *Introduction* section.

* In each session, try to include a few small exercises. These give breathing space, allowing people to catch up, and reinforce their understanding.

* each session will with more substantial exercises that the students will solve in groups in a hackathon format (these will be used in the challenge/exercise sessions), listed in  in the [Schedule](https://github.com/vectorbite/VBiTraining/blob/master/README.md).  We have budgeted 1-2 hrs for each of these followed by a discussion.

## Planned Topics

The plan is to prepare lectures and  [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/notebooks/Intro.ipynb) that cover the following materials (see [example here](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/notebooks/NLLS.ipynb)):

* *Modelling, Probability, Statisics background*
  - Intro to data management and basics of visualization - Samraat
  - Intro to modelling and fitting models to data - Samraat
  - Probability distributions and likelihoods, basics of bayesian statistics - Leah

* *Traits*: Use VecTraits data (Thermal performance curves and metabolic scaling)
  - Fit trait data to mechanistic and statistical models
    * Linear models / regression for simple trait models - allometric scaling data (log-log)
    * Non-linear Least Squares (NLLS) fitting in R  - compare Briere and Polynomial using AIC/BIC - TPC data from Martha
    * MLE/Bayesian fitting of simple models - to both

* *Population abundances:* Use VecDyn data
   - Fit population dynamics models - Logistic growth (Bacteria data)
      - NLLS
      - MLE and Bayesian
   - Fit statistical models (time series analyses) - basic AR models; time series as regression (including MLE)
      - Abundance (VecDyn) data
      - Dengue data
